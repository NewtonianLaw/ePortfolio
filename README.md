About Me 
As a Computer Science graduate from Southern New Hampshire University, I have cultivated a strong foundation in problem-solving, programming, and algorithms. My academic experience has honed my ability to translate concepts into efficient code, organize data effectively using structured algorithms, and create innovative solutions to complex challenges.

Featured Project: Pet Hotel Management System
The Pet Hotel Management System is a capstone project that demonstrates my expertise in software engineering, algorithms, and database management. Originally developed as a Java application, the system was enhanced to support both dogs and cats, showcasing my proficiency in object-oriented programming and software design.

Key Features:
Java Implementation: Developed the Pet class and its Dog subclass, utilizing constructors, accessors, and methods like checkIn(), checkOut(), and updatePet() to streamline pet management operations.
Python Adaptation: Transitioned the system to Python, employing encapsulation, property decorators, and dynamic features to enhance functionality and flexibility.
Data Structures: Incorporated a Node class and a PetLinkedList class to enable scalable and efficient pet information management.
This project reflects my ability to adapt to new programming languages, design robust systems, and solve real-world problems through logical thinking and technical expertise.
